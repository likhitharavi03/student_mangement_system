        <p>
            <b>Student Management System (EMS)</b> is a web-based application
            developed using <b>Flask</b> and <b>MySQL</b> that helps educational
             institutions manage student information in an organized and efficient
              manner. The system reduces manual work by digitizing student records 
              and providing a centralized platform for data.
        </p>
        <p>This application allows administrators to securely handle student 
            details such as personal information, academic records, and user 
            credentials. With a responsive and user-friendly interface, the 
            system ensures smooth interaction across different devices 
            including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>
